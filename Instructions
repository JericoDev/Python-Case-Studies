1. Generate a Random Number:
    - Use the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
    - This number will be what the user needs to guess.

2. Implement the While Loop:
    - Continuously ask the user to guess the number until they guess correctly or reach the maximum number of attempts (set it to 10 guesses).
    - After each guess, inform the user whether their guess is "Too high" or "Too low."

Correct Output:
Correct! You've guessed the number in (whatever your number is) guesses.

Maximum attemtps prompt:
Sorry, you've reached the maximum number of 10 guesses. The number was (whatever your number is).
